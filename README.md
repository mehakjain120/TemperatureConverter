## Getting Started

To use the temperature converter, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Code Explanation

The code for the temperature converter is relatively simple. The HTML file contains a form with two input fields, one for the temperature and one for the temperature scale. The form also has a submit button.

The JavaScript file contains the code that actually performs the temperature conversion. The code first gets the values of the input fields and then uses a simple formula to convert the temperature from one scale to the other. The converted temperature is then displayed on the screen.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The HTML file creates a form with two input fields, one for the temperature and one for the temperature scale. The form also has a submit button.
